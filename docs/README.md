* A Stripe account (for payment processing)


## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-build-a-modern
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Application:**

   * **Backend:** (from the `backend` directory)
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```

   * **Frontend:** (from the `frontend` directory)
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

### Docker Setup

1.  Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
3.  Run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.


## API Documentation

Once the application is running, access the interactive API documentation at:

* **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:8000/docs
* **ReDoc:** http://localhost:8000/redoc


## Usage

**Key Endpoints (Examples):**

* `/products`:  GET request to retrieve a list of products.  Can include query parameters for filtering and pagination.
* `/products/{product_id}`: GET request to retrieve a specific product by ID.
* `/cart`:  POST request to add an item to the cart, GET request to view the cart contents.
* `/checkout`: POST request to initiate the checkout process.


**Sample Request (GET /products):**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/products
```

**Sample Response (GET /products):**

```json
[
  {"id": 1, "name": "Product A", "price": 19.99, ...},
  {"id": 2, "name": "Product B", "price": 29.99, ...}
]
```

**(More detailed endpoint examples and usage instructions should be provided within the application's API documentation.)**
