# Deployment Guide - project-build-a-modern

This guide outlines the deployment process for "project-build-a-modern," a modern e-commerce platform.  This is a sample guide and needs to be adapted based on your specific application code and infrastructure choices.  Replace placeholders like `<your_value>` with your actual values.

## Prerequisites

**Required software and tools:**

* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Git
* A cloud provider account (AWS, GCP, or Azure - choose one)
* A text editor or IDE
* Node.js and npm (or yarn) - if applicable to your project

**System Requirements:**

* A server with sufficient CPU, RAM, and storage based on expected traffic.  The exact requirements depend on your application's scale.
* A stable internet connection.

**Account Setup:**

* **Cloud Provider:** Create an account with your chosen cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).  This involves creating a user, setting up billing, and potentially creating a project or resource group.  Follow the provider's documentation for detailed instructions.
* **Stripe:** Create a Stripe account and obtain your secret and publishable keys. These will be used for payment processing.


## Environment Setup

**Environment Variables Configuration:**

Create a `.env` file (or use your application's preferred method for environment variables) with the following variables (adapt as needed):

```
DATABASE_URL="<your_database_url>"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="<your_stripe_secret_key>"
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="<your_stripe_publishable_key>"
API_KEY="<your_api_key>" # For any other APIs you use
NODE_ENV=production # or development
PORT=3000 # or your application's port
```

**Database Setup:**

* **Create the database:** Use the appropriate command-line tool for your chosen database (e.g., `psql` for PostgreSQL, `mysql` for MySQL).
* **Database migrations:**  Run your database migration scripts to create the necessary tables and schema.  (e.g., `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`)  The exact command depends on your ORM.


**External Service Configuration:**

* **Stripe:** Configure your application to use your Stripe keys.
* **Email Service:** Configure your application to use an email service like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES.

## Docker Deployment

**Building the Docker Image:**

Navigate to your project's root directory and build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t project-build-a-modern .
```

**Running with docker-compose:**

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file (example):

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:14 # Or your database image
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=<your_db_user>
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
      - POSTGRES_DB=<your_db_name>
```

Run the application:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Environment Configuration:**  The `.env` file is mounted as a volume in `docker-compose.yml`, making environment variables accessible to the container.

**Health Checks and Monitoring:**  Implement health checks within your application to allow for monitoring.  For example, you could expose a health endpoint that returns a 200 OK status when the application is running correctly.


## Production Deployment

**Cloud Deployment Options:**

* **AWS:** Use Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, or EKS for deploying your Dockerized application.
* **GCP:** Use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Cloud Run, or App Engine.
* **Azure:** Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Container Instances (ACI), or Azure App Service.

**Container Orchestration:**

* **Kubernetes:** Deploy your application to a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., using kubectl).  This involves creating deployments, services, and other Kubernetes resources.
* **Docker Swarm:**  Deploy your application using Docker Swarm (less common for production deployments).

**Load Balancing and Scaling:**

Use your cloud provider's load balancing services to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your application.  Scale your application horizontally by adding more instances as needed.

**SSL/TLS Configuration:**

Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate (e.g., from Let's Encrypt) and configure your load balancer or web server to use it.


## Database Setup

**Database Migration Commands:**  These commands will vary depending on your ORM (e.g., Sequelize, TypeORM).  Generally, you'll have commands for migrating up (applying changes), migrating down (reverting changes), and seeding (adding initial data).

**Initial Data Setup:** Use seed scripts to populate your database with initial data (e.g., product categories, sample products).

**Backup and Recovery Procedures:**  Regularly back up your database.  Your cloud provider likely offers database backup services.  Establish a clear procedure for restoring the database from backups in case of failure.


## Monitoring & Logging

**Application Monitoring Setup:**  Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic to monitor your application's health, performance, and resource usage.

**Log Aggregation:** Use a centralized logging system like Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK stack) or a cloud-based logging service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, GCP Cloud Logging, Azure Monitor).

**Performance Monitoring:** Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response times, error rates, and throughput.

**Error Tracking:** Use error tracking services like Sentry or Rollbar to capture and analyze application errors.


## Troubleshooting

**Common Deployment Issues:**  These will vary based on your specific setup.  Common issues include network connectivity problems, database connection errors, and application crashes.

**Debug Commands:** Use `docker logs <container_name>` to view container logs.  Use your IDE's debugging tools to debug your application code.

**Log Locations:** Logs are typically located in the `/var/log` directory (or a similar location) on your server, or within your container's file system.

**Recovery Procedures:**  Have a plan for recovering from failures, including restoring from backups, restarting containers, and scaling up resources.


## Security Considerations

**Environment Variable Security:**  Do not hardcode sensitive information in your code.  Use environment variables and secure ways to manage them (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault).

**Network Security:**  Use firewalls and other security measures to protect your application from unauthorized access.

**Authentication Setup:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user accounts and data.

**Regular Security Updates:**  Keep your application and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.  Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities.


This guide provides a general framework.  You will need to adapt it to your specific application, infrastructure, and chosen technologies.  Remember to consult the documentation for your chosen cloud provider, database system, and other tools.
