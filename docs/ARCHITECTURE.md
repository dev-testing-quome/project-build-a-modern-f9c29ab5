## Technical Architecture Document: project-build-a-modern

**1. System Overview:**

`project-build-a-modern` is a modern e-commerce platform built using a microservices-ready architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.  The system will be composed of independent services communicating via a well-defined API.  This approach allows for independent scaling of individual components and facilitates easier technology upgrades and feature development.  We will employ a layered architecture (presentation, application, domain, data) to separate concerns and improve testability.  The design prioritizes clean code, robust error handling, and comprehensive monitoring for optimal performance and resilience.

**Design Principles:**

* **Modularity:** Services are designed as independent units with well-defined interfaces.
* **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling is supported through containerization and load balancing.
* **Maintainability:** Clean code, clear separation of concerns, and automated testing.
* **Security:**  Robust authentication, authorization, and data protection measures.
* **Testability:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are implemented throughout.

**2. Folder Structure:**

The proposed folder structure is a good starting point.  However, we'll refine it to accommodate microservices as we scale.  Initially, we'll keep the monolithic structure for rapid initial development, with a migration plan to microservices outlined in section 10.

```
project/
├── backend/          # Monolithic backend (initial phase) - will be refactored into microservices
│   ├── api/           # API entry point and routing
│   ├── domain/        # Business logic and domain models
│   ├── infrastructure/ # Database interactions, external API calls
│   ├── services/      # Specific services (e.g., order, product, user)
│   ├── repositories/  # Data access layer
│   ├── models.py     # SQLAlchemy models
│   ├── schemas.py    # Pydantic schemas
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── ...

│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── ...
├── services/         # Future microservices directory (e.g., order-service, product-service)
│   ├── order-service/
│   ├── product-service/
│   └── ...
├── docker/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── docker-compose.yml
└── scripts/          # Deployment and other scripts
```

**3. Technology Stack:**

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11), SQLAlchemy (ORM), Uvicorn (ASGI server)
* **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Initially SQLite for development, migrate to PostgreSQL for production scalability and robustness).
* **Caching:** Redis (for frequently accessed data, e.g., product catalog)
* **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ or Kafka (for asynchronous tasks like order processing and email notifications)
* **Search:** Elasticsearch (for advanced product search and filtering)
* **Payment Gateway:** Stripe API
* **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (for production deployment)
* **CI/CD:** GitLab CI/CD or similar


**4. Database Design:**

We'll use a relational database (PostgreSQL) with the following core entities:

* **Users:** `id`, `email`, `password`, `address`, ...
* **Products:** `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `inventory`, `category`, `images`, ...
* **Orders:** `id`, `user_id`, `order_date`, `status`, `total`, ...
* **OrderItems:** `id`, `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `price`, ...
* **Reviews:** `id`, `product_id`, `user_id`, `rating`, `review`, ...
* **Categories:** `id`, `name`, `description`

Relationships will be defined using SQLAlchemy's ORM.  Migration strategy will use Alembic for managing database schema changes.

**5. API Design:**

RESTful API principles will be followed, with clear endpoints for CRUD operations on each entity.  Authentication will be handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).  Authorization will be implemented using role-based access control (RBAC).  Versioning will be implemented using URL path versioning (e.g., `/v1/products`).

**6. Security Architecture:**

* **Authentication:** JWT with secure key management.
* **Authorization:** RBAC using roles and permissions.
* **Data Protection:** Input validation, output sanitization, encryption of sensitive data (passwords, payment information).
* **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication.
* **OWASP Top 10:** Address all relevant security risks.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Implement a schedule for regular penetration testing.

**7. Frontend Architecture:**

* **Component Organization:**  Component-based architecture using React's functional components.
* **State Management:** Redux Toolkit or Zustand for managing application state.
* **Routing:** React Router for client-side routing.
* **API Integration:**  Fetch API or Axios for making API calls.

**8. Integration Points:**

* **Stripe API:**  For payment processing.
* **Email Service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun):**  For order updates and other notifications.
* **External APIs (if any):**  Well-defined interfaces and error handling.
* **Data Exchange Formats:** JSON for API communication.


**9. Development Workflow:**

* **Local Development:**  Docker Compose for setting up a local development environment.
* **Testing:** Unit tests (pytest), integration tests, and end-to-end tests (Cypress).  Test coverage will be a key metric.
* **Build and Deployment:**  GitLab CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.
* **Environment Management:**  Use environment variables to manage configuration across different environments (development, staging, production).

**10. Scalability Considerations:**

* **Initial Phase (Monolithic):** Focus on optimizing database queries, efficient code, and caching strategies (Redis).
* **Microservices Migration (Phase 2 - 6 months):** Refactor the monolithic backend into microservices (e.g., user service, product service, order service). This allows for independent scaling of each service.
* **Load Balancing:**  Use a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) to distribute traffic across multiple instances of each microservice.
* **Database Scaling:**  Use database sharding or read replicas as needed.
* **Caching:** Implement aggressive caching strategies at multiple layers (database, application, CDN).
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Use a message queue (RabbitMQ or Kafka) to handle asynchronous tasks, improving responsiveness and scalability.
* **Kubernetes:** Deploy microservices to Kubernetes for automated scaling and management in production.

**Timeline & Resource Allocation:**

* **Phase 1 (3 months):** MVP development (Monolithic backend, basic frontend features).  Team: 2 backend engineers, 1 frontend engineer.
* **Phase 2 (6 months):** Microservices architecture migration, advanced features (search, reviews), scalability improvements. Team: 3 backend engineers, 2 frontend engineers, 1 DevOps engineer.
* **Phase 3 (Ongoing):** Continuous improvement, new features, performance optimization. Team: 4 backend engineers, 2 frontend engineers, 1 DevOps engineer.

**Risk Assessment & Mitigation:**

* **Technical Debt:**  Regular code reviews, automated testing, and a commitment to clean code will mitigate technical debt.
* **Security Vulnerabilities:**  Regular security audits, penetration testing, and adherence to security best practices are crucial.
* **Scalability Issues:**  Proactive monitoring, performance testing, and a well-defined scaling strategy will mitigate scalability concerns.


This document provides a high-level overview of the technical architecture.  Further details will be elaborated in subsequent design documents.  This plan prioritizes a phased approach, allowing for iterative development and adaptation based on user feedback and performance data.  Regular reviews and adjustments to this plan are crucial for its success.
